# GameDevTV-Skill-Builder---TRAIL-BLAZER-QUEST
3D Side Scrolling Endless Runner - Procedural generation challenge. In this quest you start off with a 3D side scrolling endless runner and are challenged to figure out procedurally generated platforms.

Challenges For This Quest
Procedural Generation:
This is a broad challenge that you can approach any way you like. Create a procedural generation system so that we can create endless platforms to run and jump on. Some hints / suggestions:
- Create a bunch of prefabbed platform sections that you can then randomly spawn one at a time from a collection
- Create a way of identifying the position of the end of the platform section so that you know where to instantiate your next section
- Consider only instantiating a new section when it is needed, perhaps by checking how close the player is to the latest section spawned

Pick Two:
Add two more gameplay mechanics to give our game more purpose and meaning. Chose two features to implement from the following list:
- Coins to collect including a coin tally on screen
- A distance meter and on screen feedback
- Enemies or traps or hazards to avoid
- Pickups that change the jumping or speed behaviour
- Shooting and destructable platforms that can be destroyed
- Moving platforms


A Different Look:
Make at least one visual change so that your game looks significantly different from the original game. Feel free to go crazy and make the game look dramatically different.
